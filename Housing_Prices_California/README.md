# üè† Housing Prices in California

This folder contains two related projects analyzing housing price trends in California:  
1. An **independent analysis** I conducted, which includes extensive exploration, feature engineering, and model building.  
2. A subsequent **group course project**, which focused on structured analysis and reporting for academic purposes.  

Together, these works demonstrate both my ability to perform **deep independent research** and to **collaborate effectively in a team setting**.
